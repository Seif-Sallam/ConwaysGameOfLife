# Conway's Game of Life
This project is a demonstration of the famous cellular automata game Conway's Game of Life. The graphics was created using SFML. ImGui is used as well to create the GUI used to manipulate the simulation.

## To compile the code:

This project was compiled and maintained on Linux Ubuntu 21.0. The project has a Makefile that compiles all the other projects needed to run this project such as _imgui_.

The required dependency is mainly [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/).

Install SFML & run make at the root folder of the project. This will generate an executable file in the build folder _Build_.
